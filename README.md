# CPU Race Condition Simulator

This program is the final project of the OS class I took, but I thought it might be cool if other people can add more to it.

## First Time implementing (If you want to add more to the code, etc) **_[Eclipse IDE]_**

I only studied eclipse and used eclipse in this project. Meaning that the installation and preperation part is mainly focused on Eclipse.

`Note that other IDEs should be quite similar, hopefully!`

1) Install JavaFX
>- Start Eclipse
>- Go to Help -> Eclipse Marketplace -> Search for e(fx)clipse & install
>- Restart your IDE 
>- Download javafx SDK externally once more `What I used: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/`
>- Extract the the files somewhere on you computer

2) Fork the source code

3) Import the project into Eclipse

4) Right Click on the Project in Eclipse and Select Buildpath -> Configure Build Path -> Go to the Libraries Tab

5) Select Classpath and Click Add External JARs

>- Here you want to go to the extracted folder and go to the lib folder `Which should look similar to this .../javafx-sdk-"Your javafx Verson"\lib`
>- In there all Executable Jar Files have to be selected and then click on open

6) Select Classpath once more and click on Add Library
>- Select JavaFX SDK press Next -> Finish
>- You can close this window

7) Right Click on the Project in Eclipse once more and Select Run As -> Run Configurations
>- Go to Arguments and under VM arguments copy this into the text box: <br/>
`--module-path 'Your path to lib folder'  --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml`

8) Press apply and you should be ready to go.

9) Run the program by Running the Main.java File. ðŸ‘Š

## Running the code

You can simply run/export the project after you completed the steps above.

Additionally you can install Scene Builder from Gluon if you want to add elements, but don't wanna code pure XML.

>- The Program will start as the Race Condition Prevention mode, where before each read of the stack, the other processes will be locked out from trying to read.

>- This can of cause be changed on the mode section above.

>- The unprotected mode will let you play around without any Stack protection, meaning values from the stack can be read by any process at any time.

## Concluding Notes

Even though it should work as intended, small bugs and errors might occur. Additionally the code is not clean and optimized what so ever, as this project as it currently is was done in 1 week and before I have studied any optimization classes, therefore I made it so it `works` rather than `it looks good`.
